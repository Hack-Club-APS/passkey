# Passkey
This passkey is made so that the user can login without using a password. Using the picokeys firmware for raspberry pi microcontrollers, it is pretty secure(FIDO2) and fun to use. Even though it has a small form factor, it carries one button and a white LED - enough for passwordless login and some custom HID stuff.
